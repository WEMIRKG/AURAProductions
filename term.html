            We accept payment through third-party platforms such as Venmo, PayPal, and Cash App. By using

            Our work combines AI tools with human creative direction and editing. While we aim for high
            quality, AI-generated content can sometimes include variations or unexpected details. By
            ordering from us, you acknowledge this and agree that minor imperfections do not constitute
            grounds for a refund.

            Each package includes a specific number of revisions and an estimated delivery window, as
            described on the Pricing page. Revisions refine the existing concept and do not reset the
            project from scratch.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            We make reasonable efforts to meet timelines, but delivery dates may shift based on your
            response times, revision requests, or technical issues. Dates are estimates unless confirmed
            in writing as a hard deadline.
