          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            By accessing this website or purchasing any Service, you represent that you are at least
            18 years old and have the authority to agree to these Terms on behalf of yourself or your
            organization.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Use of the Site</h3>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            You agree to use this website only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not violate
            any applicable laws, regulations, or the rights of others. You may not attempt to gain

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>3. Purchases & Payments</h3>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            Pricing for our packages is listed on the Pricing page and may be updated from time to time.
            Payment is due in full before production begins, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            We currently accept payment through third-party services such as Venmo, PayPal, and Cash App.
            By using these services, you also agree to their respective terms and policies. Aura
            Productions is not responsible for issues or disputes arising from those third-party
            platforms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>4. AI-Generated & Creative Content</h3>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            Our work often combines AI tools (for visuals, voice, music, or scripting) with human
            creative direction and editing. While we aim for a high level of quality and originality,
            AI-generated content may sometimes show artifacts, unexpected details, or results that are
            slightly different from references.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            By using our Services, you acknowledge and accept the nature of AI-assisted content and
            agree that minor variations or imperfections do not constitute grounds for a refund.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>5. Revisions, Delivery & Deadlines</h3>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            Each package includes a specific number of revisions and standard delivery time, as
            described on the Pricing page. Revisions are intended to refine the existing concept, not
            to create a completely new project from scratch.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            We make reasonable efforts to meet agreed timelines, but delivery dates may shift based on
            your response times, revision requests, or unforeseen technical issues. Any dates provided
            are estimates and not guaranteed deadlines unless explicitly confirmed in writing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>6. No Guarantees of Results</h3>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            Our Services are designed to support your marketing, branding, and communication efforts,
            but we cannot guarantee specific results such as a certain number of views, clicks, leads,
            or sales. Performance depends on many factors outside our control, including your offer,
            pricing, targeting, platform algorithms, audience behavior, and market conditions.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            You agree that Aura Productions is not responsible for your business outcomes and does not
            provide financial, legal, or tax advice.

          <h3>7. Refunds & Cancellations</h3>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            Because our work is custom-created for each client, <strong>all sales are generally
            final</strong> once production has begun. At our sole discretion, we may offer partial
            credits or adjustments in exceptional circumstances, but these are not guaranteed.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            If you wish to cancel before any work has started, contact us as soon as possible. We
            reserve the right to deduct administrative or planning time already invested into your
            project.

            Unless otherwise stated in writing, full usage rights to the final delivered commercial or
            asset (within the agreed platforms and purposes) are granted to you upon full payment.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            Raw project files, working files, or intermediate assets (such as project timelines,
            layered files, or unused concepts) remain the intellectual property of Aura Productions,
            unless additional licensing or buy-out is negotiated separately.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            You represent that any logos, trademarks, names, images, voice, or other materials you

            supply.

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>9. Client Responsibilities</h3>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            You agree to provide accurate information, timely feedback, and any required approvals to
            keep the project moving. Delays in your responses or approvals may shift delivery timelines.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            You are responsible for reviewing all deliverables and notifying us of any issues or
            necessary corrections within a reasonable time frame, especially before using the content
            in public campaigns.

          <h3>11. Third-Party Services & Tools</h3>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            Our site and services may rely on third-party tools such as AI providers, email tools,
            payment processors, and form services (for example, Formspree, PayPal, Venmo, Cash App,
            etc.). We do not control these platforms and are not responsible for their actions, terms,
            or policies.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            Your use of any third-party service is governed by that provider’s own terms and privacy
            policy.

            Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
          </p>
          <p class="disclosure-text">
            In any case, our total liability for any claim related to the Services shall not exceed the
